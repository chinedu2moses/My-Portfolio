                    <p>Deep Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and a subset of machine learning that focuses on networks capable of, 
                       usually, unsupervised learning from unstructured and other forms of data. It is also known as deep structured learning or
                       differential programming. </p>
                    <p>Architectures inspired by deep learning find use in a range of fields, 
                        such as audio recognition, bioinformatics, board game programs, computer 
                        vision, machine translation, material inspection, and social media filtering.
                        Deep learning networks have tremendous capability in terms of accuracy. While 
                        training a deep learning net, there is a range of parameters that require adjusting.

                        <h5>1. Eclipse Deeplearning4j</h5> 
                        <ul>Developer – Konduit team and the DL4J community
                        Since – N/A
                        Type – Toolkit
                        Written in – C, C++, Clojure, CUDA, Java, Python, Scala</ul>
                        
                        Eclipse Deeplearning4j is a distributed, open-source, production-ready deep learning toolkit designed for Java, Scala, and the JVM. 
                        DL4J has the ability to leverage distributed computing frameworks, to the likes of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, for delivering a powerful AI performance.
                        In environments utilizing multi-GPUs, Deeplearning4j can equal the deep learning framework Caffe in terms of performance. 
                        Although written in Java, the underlying computations of DL4J are written in C, C++, and CUDA.
                        DL4J lets developers compose deep neural networks from a range of shallow networks. Each of 
                        them forms a kind of ‘layer’ while adding them in a deep neural net designed using the Deeplearning4j toolkit.
                        Deeplearning4j allows combining convolutional networks, sequence-to-sequence autoencoders, recurrent networks, 
                        or variational autoencoders as required in a distributed, commercial framework working with Hadoop and/or Spark on top of distributed CPUs or GPUs.
                        
                        <h5>Highlights:</h5>

                       </ul>
                        <h5>2. TensorFlow</h5>
                       <ul> Developer – Google Brain Team
                        Since – November 2015
                        Type – Library
                        Written in – C++, CUDA, Python</ul>
                        
                        <p>Ever since its release back in 2015, TensorFlow has succeeded to become one of the most beloved deep learning, and machine learning, 
                        libraries. Backed by the tech mogul Google, TensorFlow provides support for multi-CPU, and -GPU performance.
                        As a machine learning platform, TensorFlow is replete with flexible tools, libraries, and community resources. 
                        It allows developers to easily and quickly build and deploy DL and ML-powered applications.
                        TensorFlow allows developers to choose a fitting option from its multiple levels of abstraction. For matching 
                        humongous ML model training tasks requirements, the deep learning library offers the Distribution Strategy 
                        API that allows distributed training on different hardware configurations without essentially altering the model definition.
                        
                        <h5>Highlights:</h5>
                        <ul>
                        <li> Ample documentation.
                        <li>Build and train ML models with intuitive high-level APIs facilitating immediate model iteration as well as easy debugging.
                        <li>Simple and flexible architecture fosters powerful experimentation/research.

                                    <li>TensorFlow Trusted Partner Pilot Program
                                        <li>Train and deploy models in the browser (TensorFlow.js), in the cloud, on a device (TensorFlow Lite), 
                        and on-premises (TensorFlow Extended). </ul>
                        <h5>3. Theano</h5>
                       <ul> Developer – MILA (Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms), University of Montreal
                        Since – 2007
                        Type – Library
                        Written in – CUDA, Python</ul>
                        
                        <p>Another powerful library available for deep learning is Theano. It lets developers define, evaluate, 
                         and optimize mathematical expressions that involve multi-dimensional arrays in an effective way. Theano 
                         is a free and open-source tool available under The 3-Clause BSD License.
                         Theano does derivatives for functions with one or many inputs. The Python library has tight integration 
                         with NumPy, allowing using numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions. As it supports dynamic C code generation, 
                         expressions are evaluated faster.
                         In scenarios involving different expressions that are evaluated once, Theano minimizes the analysis or 
                         compilation overhead while still offering symbolic features, like automatic differentiation.
                        Unfortunately, a major development for the deep learning library has ceased since the release 
                        of Theano 1.0.0 in November of 2017. The maintenance of the Python library, nonetheless, now 
                        rests in the hands of the PyMC development team.
                        
                        <h5>Highlights:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Combines aspects of a CAS (Computer Algebra System) with aspects of an optimizing compiler.

                        With easy extensibility and modularity, Keras enables easy and rapid prototyping. The high-level neural networks API flaunts the ability to run on top 
                        of other state-of-the-art deep learning libraries and toolkits, namely Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow, and Theano.
                        Keras provides support for both convolutional and recurrent networks. Furthermore, it also supports networks that are a combination 
                        of these two network types.
                         As models developed using Keras are described completely using the Python code, they are compact, 
                         easier to debug, and offer great ease when it comes to extensibility.

                        </ul>
                        <h5>6. Sonnet</h5>
                        <ul>
                         Developer – DeepMind
                        Since – 2017
                        Type – Library
                        Written in – N/A
                         </ul>
                         <p>
                        Built on top of TensorFlow 2, Sonnet aims to offer simple, composable abstractions for ML research. Developed by DeepMind, 
                        the deep learning library can be employed for accomplishing various types of learning, including reinforcement and unsupervised learning.
                        Sonnet’s simple-yet-powerful programming model is based on the concept of modules i.e. snt.Module. Sonnet modules have the ability to 
                        hold references to methods, other modules, and parameters. These modules are self-contained, entirely independent units.
                        Things in Sonnet start with the construction of primary Python objects for specific parts of a neural net. Next, these Python 
                        objects are connected, in an independent manner, to the computational TF graph.
                        Separating the processes of creating Python objects and associating the same with the 
                        TF graph, results in simplifying the design of high-level architectures.
                        Sonnet comes with a range of pre-built modules, such as snt.BatchNorm and snt.Linear, 
                        and pre-built network of modules, such as snt.nets.MLP. Developers, however,
